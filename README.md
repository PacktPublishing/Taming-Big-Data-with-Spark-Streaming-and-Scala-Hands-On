## About the Video Course
Businesses these days require constant, real-time analysis of large amounts of data, along with meaningful insights which influence business decisions. Apache Spark has emerged as the most popular tool in the Big Data market for efficient real-time analytics of Big Data. Spanning over 5 hours, this course will teach you the basics of Apache Spark and how to use Spark Streaming - a module of Apache Spark which involves handling and processing of Big Data on a real-time basis. You will learn how to create Spark applications with Scala to process streams of real-time data. Whether you want to analyze continuously incoming website traffic, analyze real-time streams of Twitter feeds or query your streaming data in real time, this course has got you covered. You will also learn how to use the MLlib module of Spark to train machine learning models with streaming data, and use those models to make real-time predictions. The course assumes some programming experience, and uses Scala to develop Spark applications. It includes a crash course in the Scala programming language in case you're new to it.
